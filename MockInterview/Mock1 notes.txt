What is JavaScript, and what are its key features?
-JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for web 
development. 
-Its key features include being lightweight, easy to learn, and designed to add interactivity to web 
pages.

How is JavaScript different from other programming languages?
- JavaScript has a unique features like loose typing system, dynamic runtime and closures.

What is ECMAScript? 
-ECMAScript (ES6)

Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language? 
-JavaScript in a interpreted language does not require a separate compilation step
-JavaScript code is executed line by line. 

Is there any relation between Java and JavaScript? 
-They have similar names but java and JavaScript are two entirely different programming languages
-Java is statically typed and JavaScript is dynamically typed

What are the differences between var, let, and const?
- var-let-const keywords are used for variables
-var is a keyword that was used from 1995 to 2015 The var keyword was traditionally used to declare variables, but let and const were introduced 
in newer versions of JavaScript (ES6)
- let allows us to change the value of the variables at any point in the program
- const stands for constant, const variables have final values which cannot be changed

List and briefly describe the basic data types in JavaScript.
-There are 7 primitives: String, Number, Bigint, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol
-There are also Reference-Object data types: arrays, objects
1. String: Strings are used for storing and text. You can use single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.
2. Number: A numric data type that represents whole numbers or decimal numbers.
3. BigInt: It can store very large numbers that are too big to be represtened by a normal JavaScript number.
4. Boolean: it can have only two values: true or false. it often used with conditional statments.
5. undefined: a variable without a vlue, has the value undifined.
6. Null: a value that represtents the intentional absense of any object value.
7. symbol: a unique value used as an indentifier for object properties.


How can you check the type of a variable in JavaScript?
-You can use the typeof operator.

What are the differences between == and ===? 
- == loose equality 
- === strict equality

How do you convert a string to a number in JavaScript?
- Use the parseInt() or parseFloat()

What are the differences between integers and floating-point numbers in 
JavaScript?
-integers are whole numbers without fractional parts 
-Floating-Point number allow for decimal fractions

What is an undefined property? 
-is a property that has not been assigned a value or does not exist in an object

What is null value?
-a value that represtents the intentional absense of any object value.

What is the difference between null and undefined? 
-null a value that represtents the intentional absense of any object value.
-undifined is a property that has not been assigned a value or does not exist in an object.

What are variable declaration and assignment in JavaScript?
-variables in javaScript are declared using the var, let, const keywords

What is isNaN?
-It checks wheather a value is "Not-a-Number"

What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables?
-An undeclared variable is a variable that has not been declared (created) using the var, let, or 
const keywords. if you try to access an undeclkared variable in JS it will throw a Refrence error.
-An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared, but no value has been assigned to it. 
If you access an undefined variable, it will return the value undefined.

What are identifiers in JavaScript and what are the rules to follow for identifiers?
-In JS indentifiers are names used to uniquely identify variables, functions, objects, or 
other things in the code.
-They can only start with a letter, underscore or $ sign 
-subsequent charecters can include letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
- identifiers are case sensitve mean myVariable and myvariable are different.

What is string concatenation and how do you concatenate two strings in 
JavaScript? 
-string concatenation is forming a string within a string.
- you can use the + operator the concat() method or template literals.

What are the differences between string concatenation and interpolation?
-String concatenation involves joining multiple strings together to create a new string. 
-String interpolation, also known as template literals, allows you to embed expressions or 
variables directly within a string

Can you explain the concept of escaping characters in strings? 
• Escaping characters allows you to include special characters within a string by using escape 
sequences. 
\n inserts a new line 
\t inserts a tab space 
\" inserts double quote 
\' inserts single quote 
\\ inserts backslas

What are the truthy/falsy values in JavaScript?
• Falsy Values:  
-These are values that are considered "false" when evaluated in a boolean context. 
-Common examples of falsy values include: 
-The number 0. 
-An empty string (""). 
-null. 
-Undefined. 
-NaN (Not-a-Number). 
-The boolean value false 
-Truthy Values:  
-These are values that are considered ”true" when evaluated in a boolean context. In 
most programming languages, values that are not specifically considered "false" are 
treated as truthy. Common examples of truthy values include: 
-Numbers other than 0. 
-Non-empty strings. 
-Objects and arrays, which are considered true even if they are empty. 
-Functions. 
-The boolean value true

What is nullish coalescing operator (??)?

undefined

What is the use/purpose of functions in JavaScript?
-Functions in JS are reusable blocks of code, Function: is a block of code we can execute for a task
It increases reusability of the code 
-They allow grouping a set of instructions and execute them whenever needed.
-Functions promote code reusablity 
-They help break down complex tasxs into smaller, more managiable units.
-They can be used multiple times through the code.

What are if-else statements in JavaScript and what are they used for?
• JavaScript if-else statements are used to test specific conditions and control the flow of the 
program based on those conditions. 
• They execute a block of code if a given condition is true, and another block of code if the 
condition is false.
